# Mathematica Code for Visualizing Monodromy Groups and Solving Quintics Using the Icosahedron

This repository contains Mathematica code I developed as part of my research report at McGill University on Felix Klein's lectures on the icosahedron, with a focus on Bruce Bartlett's recent article published in the *American Mathematical Society*. The code was created during my reading course this semester and is not an expert-level implementation but reflects my exploration and understanding of these mathematical topics.

## Features

1. **Visualization of Monodromy Groups of Families of Polynomials**  
   The code includes a program to visualize the behavior of roots of polynomials and their associated monodromy groups. This allows for a better understanding of the symmetries inherent in these polynomials, particularly as parameters vary.

2. **Implementation of Klein's Icosahedron Method for Quintics**  
   I have implemented an algorithm to solve a Brioschi quintic equation of the form:

   $$
   x^5 + 10bx^3 + 45b^2x + b^2
   $$

   by using the symmetries of the icosahedron. This method provides a geometric approach to finding the roots of quintic equations and serves as a computational implementation of Kleinâ€™s approach, and in particular follows the algorithm listed at the end of Bartlett's article (Bartlett, B. (2024). *The Quintic, the Icosahedron, and Elliptic Curves*. *Notices of the American Mathematical Society*, 71, 1. https://doi.org/10.1090/noti2923)
